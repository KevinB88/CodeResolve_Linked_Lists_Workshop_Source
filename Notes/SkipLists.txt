1. Databases: Skip lists are used as the underlying data structure for indexing in some database systems
, providing quick access to data records.

2. Distributed Systems: They are employed in distributed data structures,
where the probabilistic balancing offers a simpler alternative to maintaining strict tree balance.

3. Cache Systems: Skip lists can be used in memory caches for quick lookup of cached items.

4. Concurrent Algorithms: The structure of skip lists facilitates easier implementation of lock-free and concurrent algorithms,
making them suitable for multi-threaded applications.
